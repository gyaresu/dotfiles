RPC MODULE!), _you_ just worry about calling the right function, _I'll_ decide where you go...\n\nupdate: [dnode@1.0.0](https://github.com/substack/dnode) now has first class streams, and you can pipe it where you like! \n\n## usage\n\n```\nvar rpc = require('rpc-stream')\n\n//create a server, that answers questions.\n//pass in functions that may be called remotely.\nvar server = rpc({hello: function (name, cb) {\n  cb(null, 'hello, '+name)\n}})\n\n//create a client, that asks questions.\nvar client = rpc()\n\n//pipe rpc instances together!\nclient.pipe(server).pipe(client)\n\nvar remote = client.wrap(['hello'])\nremote.hello('JIM', function (err, mess) {\n  if(err) throw err\n  console.log(mess)\n})\n```\n\n### rpc(methods, isRaw)\n\nreturns a `RpcStream` that will call `methods` when written to. If the `isRaw` parameter is set to `true`, `JSON.stringify()`\nis turned off and you just get a stream of objects, in case you want to do your own parsing/stringifying.\n\n### RpcStream\\#wrap(methodNames)\n\nreturns a wrapped object with the remote's methods.\nthe client needs to already know the names of the methods.\naccepts a string, and array of strings, or a object.\nif it's an object, `wrap` will use the keys as the method names. \n\n```\n//create rpc around the fs module.\nvar fsrpc = rpc(require('fs'))\n//pipe, etc\n```\n\nthen, in another process...\n\n```\nvar fsrpc = rpc()\n//pipe, etc\n\n//wrap, with the right method names.\nvar remoteFs = fs.wrap(require('fs'))\n\nremoteFs.mkdir('/tmp/whatever', function (err, dir) {\n  //yay!  \n})\n\n```\n\nnow, the second process can call the `fs` module in the first process!\n`wrap` does not use the methods for anything. it just wants the names.\n\n### RpcStream#rpc(name, args, cb)\n\nthis gets invoked by wrap. but you could call it directly.\n\n``` js\nrpc().wrap('hello').hello(name, callback)\n//is the same as\nrpc().rpc('hello', [name], callback)\n```\n\n### RpcStream#pipe\n\nthis is why we are here. read [this](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipe_destination_options) and [this](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js)\n\n\n## license\n\nMIT/APACHE2\n","readmeFilename":"readme.markdown","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dominictarr/rpc-stream/issues"},"_id":"rpc-stream@1.0.5","dist":{"shasum":"6de60b5c5f7990728e4f37e5d40b36d94b93e7b2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rpc-stream/-/rpc-stream-1.0.5.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"_etag":"\"E5ITXQDY3ZT6EH2DU6HLBHNQ6\""}
